# MEDICAL-COST-PREDICTOR
Predict medical charges using linear regression
# Medical Cost Estimation using Linear Regression

This project builds a predictive model to estimate annual medical insurance charges based on customer data such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used comes from [Medical Cost Personal Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) and includes 1300+ customer records.

## 🔧 Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)

## 📈 Highlights
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized relationships between features and charges
- Built a linear regression model using Scikit-learn
- Achieved an RMSE of ~$4600 on non-smoker data

## 📁 Files
